# episoder üéôÔ∏èüß†
Create pull requests for podcast websites using provided transcripts and GenAI.

## Overview
This an AWS SAM project that takes podcast transcripts generated by [Podwhisperer](https://github.com/fourTheorem/podwhisperer) and performs two steps:

1. Use an Amazon Bedrock LLM to summarise the episode and create draft YouTube chapters
2. Create a Pull Request for the podcast's website source code containing the summary and the transcript content

An example of a Pull Request generated by this project can be found [here](https://github.com/awsbites/aws-bites-site/pull/143).

## GenAI / LLM use
We currently use the (Anthropic Claude V2](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-2) Large Language Model (LLM) in Amazon Bedrock

## Prerequisites
1. The project assumes that JSON transcripts are created upstream in an S3 Bucket by [Podwhisperer](https://github.com/fourTheorem/podwhisperer).
2. You will need the following build tooling installed.
  - Node.js 18.x and NPM 8.x
  - [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/), used to build and deploy most of the application
  - The [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
  - esbuild
3. By default, the target AWS account should have the [SLIC Watch](https://github.com/fourTheorem/slic-watch) SAR Application installed. It can be installed by going to [this page](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/eu-west-1/949339270388/slic-watch-app) in the AWS Console. SLIC Watch is used to create alarms and dashboards for our transcription application. If you want to skip this option, just remove the single line referring to the `SlicWatch-v2` macro from [template.yaml](./template.yaml).
4. You will need to go to the Amazon Bedrock Console and enable the Anthropic Claude v2 model in "Model Settings"
5. Enable access to the website repository for your podcast with an SSM SecureString parameter in your AWS account:

|Parameter |Description |Example Value | 
|-- |-- |-- |
|`/episoder/gitHubUserCredentials` | Personal Access Token (PAT) for the GitHub repository | `username:github_pat_123AB...xyz` |
```

```

 
## Deployment

Using AWS SAM:
```bash
sam build --parallel
sam deploy --guided
```

You will be prompted for:
 - the S3 Bucket where transcripts are expected to arrive
 - the region to use for Bedrock, since Bedrock is currently only available in a limited number of regions
 - The email address and name to use for Git commits
 - The HTTPS URL of your website GitHub repository, e.g., `https://github.com/awsbites/aws-bites-site.git`

Once deployment has completed, you can check the Step Function that orchestrates the whole process in the AWS Console. This state machine is automatically executed when transcripts are placed in the `processed-transcripts/` prefix.
